abstract = "The partial correlation coefficient is a commonly used measure to assess the conditional dependence between two random variables. We provide a thorough explanation of the partial copula, which is a natural generalization of the partial correlation coefficient, and investigate several of its properties. In addition, properties of some associated partial dependence measures are examined."
