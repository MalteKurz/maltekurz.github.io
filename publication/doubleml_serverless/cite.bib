abstract = {This paper explores serverless cloud computing for double machine learning. Being based on repeated cross-fitting, double machine learning is particularly well suited to exploit the high level of parallelism achievable with serverless computing. It allows to get fast on-demand estimations without additional cloud maintenance effort. We provide a prototype Python implementation DoubleML-Serverless for the estimation of double machine learning models with the serverless computing platform AWS Lambda and demonstrate its utility with a case study analyzing estimation times and costs.},
